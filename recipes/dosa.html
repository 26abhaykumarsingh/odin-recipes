    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dosa is a thin batter-based dish (usually crispy) originating from South India, made from a fermented batter
        predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a
        fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but
        now have been popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and
        sambar in recent times. Chutney is a fine paste made up of groundnut, coconut and lentil.</p>
